# Slot Mechanism Acceptance

Last updated: 2026-02-08  
Status: Active Phase C governance artifact

## Purpose

Define the non-negotiable mechanics requirements for the slot and frame interface,
and the evidence required before accepting geometry changes.

## Non-Negotiables

1. True vertical negative-space slot
- A continuous insertion corridor must exist from slot entry to seat.
- No internal obstructions may block vertical ball insertion.

2. Hemispherical seat terminus
- Each slot terminates in a hemispherical seat that cradles the pivot ball.
- Seat geometry must remain centered on the locked reference axes.

3. Entry wall slope and clearance behavior
- Entry shaping may improve insertion, but must not reduce corridor clearance below gate thresholds.
- Side-wall skin must remain intact; no external breakthrough from slot cavities.

4. Locked interface coordinates
- Slot axis targets stay at `x = +/-16.0 mm`, `y = +/-33.0 mm` (reference frame spacing and pivot Y).
- Slot entry and seat depth relationship stays locked to the reference model coordinate mapping.

## Acceptance Tolerances (Deterministic Gates)

Source of truth: `codex_hull_lab/tools/verify_reference_fit.py`

| Gate | Threshold |
|---|---|
| `slot_axis_positions` | axis error <= `0.25 mm` |
| `slot_depth` | `7.0 mm +/- 0.05 mm` |
| `slot_insertion_corridor` | min corridor radial clearance >= `0.08 mm` |
| `frame_interference` | min frame gap >= `0.08 mm` and penetration <= `0.01 mm` |
| `frame_floor_clearance` | minimum floor clearance >= `2.0 mm` (current CI baseline) |

Reference dimensions:
- slot diameter: `7.5 mm`
- frame ball diameter: `7.25 mm`
- nominal radial fit target: `0.125 mm`

## Required Validation Artifacts

1. Authoritative full validation report:
- `_codex/reports/full_validation_report.json`
- Generated by:
  - `python codex_hull_lab/tools/validate_full.py --output-json _codex/reports/full_validation_report.json`
- Must show:
  - `pass = true`
  - `gates.command_suite = true`
  - `gates.robustness_sweep = true`
  - `gates.kinematic_swing_path = true`
  - `gates.manufacturability = true`
  - `gates.golden_geometry_signatures = true`

2. Deterministic mechanics sub-report:
- `_codex/reports/reference_fit_report.json`
- Produced by `validate_full.py` and still consumed by hook checks.
- Must show:
  - `pass = true`
  - all mechanics gates above are `true`

3. Regression test evidence:
- `python tests/test_reference_fit.py`
- Must pass without skipped core assertions.

4. Session/audit traceability:
- Record meaningful mechanics changes in:
  - `codex_hull_lab/docs/ITERATION_LOG.md`
  - `_codex/AUDIT_REPORT.md`

## Hard-Fail Conditions

Any of the following is an acceptance failure:
- `slot_insertion_corridor = false`
- `frame_interference = false`
- `frame_floor_clearance = false`

These are treated as blocking mechanics failures in governance checks.
