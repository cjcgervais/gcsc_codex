# Hull Spec

Last updated: 2026-02-07

## Product Behavior Target

This lab implements a decorative thematic soap-drying mechanism with locked
GCSC v5.3 interface geometry, including:

- frame columns at `x = +/-16`,
- seat-stop floor rises at `x = +/-32`,
- decorative/functional center stop at `x = 0`,
- four hemispherical-terminus slots (`d = 7.5`) for frame-ball seating/swing.

## Mechanical Rules Implemented

- No internal frame ribs/support cages.
- No pivot columns in the active build path.
- Slots are true vertical cuts at locked coordinates with hemispherical termini.
- Slot housing is reinforced by localized sidewall bands (not columns) at the
  slot interface zone.
- Slot centerlines are locked at `y = +/-33` for CF frame compatibility.
- Bow and stern are explicitly capped (`end_cap_mm >= wall_mm`).
- Flat-bottom hull floor acts as countertop "waterline" footprint.
- 4 recessed foot pockets are cut directly into the thick floor.
- Streamlined no-bulge profile is enforced by `no_bulge_on = true`.
- Bow/stern curvature is enhanced via `keel_end_lift_mm` and gunwale controls.
- Wall thickness is center-heavy and algorithmically tapered toward ends.

## Floor + Footprint

- Flat-bottom behavior is enforced by `flat_bottom_on = true` plus updated
  profile math (`gcsc_keel_lift_at()` disabled in flat mode).
- Thick floor is controlled by `floor_mm`.
- Four foot recesses are generated by `gcsc_foot_recess_cutouts()`.
- Default foot recess geometry: `8.0 mm` diameter, `1.0 mm` depth.
- Default beam target is `74 mm` with widened flat footprint ratio.

## Validation

- `tests/render_test.scad`
- `tests/parameter_sweep.scad`
- `tests/reference_assembly_check.scad`

Primary STL validation target for single connected hull:

- `src/gcsc_hull_entry.scad` export
- `watertight = true`
- `is_volume = true`
- single connected component
