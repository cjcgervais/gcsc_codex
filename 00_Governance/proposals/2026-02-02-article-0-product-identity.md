# Constitutional Amendment: Article 0 - Product Identity

**Proposal Date:** 2026-02-02
**Proposed By:** User (Chad) with Claude Code assistance
**Authority:** GCSC2_Constitution.md Article VIII (Constitutional Amendments)
**Amendment Type:** CRITICAL - Foundational product definition missing
**Target Version:** Constitution v2.1.0

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem:** The Constitution defines HOW to develop GCSC2 but never defines WHAT GCSC2 IS as a product concept.

**Root Cause:** No product definition in governance. LLMs generated closed vessels because no document establishes "this is an open-topped canoe-shaped soap dish with pivoting frame mechanism."

**Proposed Fix:** Add Article 0 (Product Identity) defining the core concept, functional purpose, and visual identity without prescribing implementation details.

---

## Governance Failure Evidence

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Issue:** Phase 1 hull rendered as sealed submarine instead of open canoe
**Detection:** User visual inspection
**Documentation:** `docs/OPEN_TOP_CANOE_REQUIREMENT.md`

**Root Cause:** No governance document establishes what "Great Canadian Soap Canoe" means. LLMs have no context for the product concept.

---

## Design Philosophy for Article 0

**Article 0 defines:**
- ✅ WHAT the product is (concept, purpose, identity)
- ✅ WHY it exists (functional requirements)
- ✅ VISUAL FORM (canoe aesthetic, mechanical character)

**Article 0 does NOT define:**
- ❌ HOW to implement it (that's for research and phases)
- ❌ Specific geometry approaches (those are research-driven)
- ❌ Technical implementation details (those evolve through phases)

**Concept Source:**
- Original vision: GCSC_v2.6.1 (conceptual seed - WHAT it should be)
- Working reference: v5.3 Final Assembly (Inheritable_Dimensions - proof it works)
- Implementation approach: GCSC2 research-backed design (to be determined)

---

## Proposed Amendment Text

### Article 0: Product Identity and Core Concept

**SUPREME AUTHORITY:** This article defines WHAT we are building. All other articles define HOW to build it. Product concept supersedes implementation details.

---

#### 0.1 Product Concept and Core Innovation

**The Great Canadian Soap Canoe (GCSC)** is a revolutionary soap dish that **elevates the soap above the vessel** using a gimbaled frame mechanism, enabling drainage-free airflow drying.

---

### THE CONCEPTUAL CORNERSTONE (Creator's 5-Year Innovation)

**THIS IS THE HEART OF GCSC - 5 years of development to solve soap preservation through mechanical elevation and gimbal action.**

**Traditional soap dishes (the problem):**
- Soap sits IN the dish (rests on bottom)
- Requires drain holes to prevent water pooling
- Soap remains wet, deteriorates quickly, becomes mushy

**GCSC Innovation (the solution):**
- **Soap is ELEVATED** - Suspended on frame top members, NOT resting in hull
- **NO DRAIN HOLES** - Water drips off elevated soap to hull floor, evaporates via airflow
- **Minimal contact** - Two thin rail edges support soap (line contact, not surface contact)
- **Gimbal gripping** - Frame swing + soap weight/placement creates frictional bite
- **Airflow drying** - Open top enables evaporation, soap stays dry and lasts longer

**This is NOT a canoe. This is NOT a traditional soap dish.**
**This is a SOAP PRESERVATION device using gimbal mechanics and elevation.**

---

### Core Mechanism: Gimbal-Based Soap Elevation System

**How the innovation works:**

#### 1. Frame-Hull Gimbal Connection (CRITICAL MECHANISM)

**The Stator (Hull):**
- Hull sidewalls contain SLOTS that enable frame swing
- Slot geometry: Opens in hull sidewall, depth sufficient for ball joint
- Slot floor: CONCAVE surface that cradles the pivot ball
- Hull wall thickness: MUST be sufficient to house slots AND maintain structural integrity
- Slots positioned symmetrically on both sides of hull

**The Rotor (Frames):**
- Two inverse trapezoid frames (narrower bottom, wider at top)
- Positioned across X-axis (canoe length direction)
- Ball joints extend LATERALLY from frame sides into hull slots
- Balls seat in concave slot floor, enabling pivot action

**The Pivot Connection:**
- Frame ball joints extend laterally INTO hull sidewall slots
- Ball rests in concave slot floor (enables smooth rotation)
- Hull wall acts as BEARING for gimbal motion
- Connection allows frame to swing freely within designed limits

#### 2. Swing Limitation System (<45° Maximum)

**CRITICAL: Frames must swing freely but be LIMITED to <45° rotation**

**Why <45° limit matters:**
- Prevents frame from swinging too far (falling out, jamming)
- Ensures controlled gimbal action for soap gripping
- Maintains functional geometry for soap elevation
- Symmetrical limits on both directions of swing

**Implementation approaches (research-driven):**
- **v5.3 approach:** Canoe seat (floor rise) acts as physical swing stop
- **Alternative:** Hull geometry provides structural stop
- **Alternative:** Slot geometry limits ball travel
- **Requirement:** Some structural property of hull design MUST limit swing symmetrically

**Design constraint:**
- Whatever limits swing must be SYMMETRICAL (both sides equal)
- Must stop rotation at <45° in both directions
- Must not interfere with normal gimbal operation
- Must be robust (repeated swings, soap loading)

#### 3. Frame Geometry for Soap Support

**Frame Structure:**
- Two inverse trapezoid frames (narrower at bottom, wider at top)
- Positioned across X-axis (length of canoe)
- Top members span Y-axis (width of canoe)
- Weight distribution: Bottom heavier, creates self-righting bias

**Top Member Critical Geometry:**
- Profile: Flat top transitioning to sharp/right-angle (90°) edges
- Purpose: The edge transition creates GRIPPING BITE on soap
- Width: Spans Y-axis (frame to frame across canoe width)
- Contact: Minimal line contact, not surface contact

#### 4. Soap Placement and Gimbal Dynamics

**Soap Placement:**
- Soap bar rests ACROSS the two frame top members
- Contact: Two minimal lines along top member edges
- Position: ABOVE hull interior (elevated, not touching floor)
- Placement bias: Where soap sits determines tilt direction

**Gimbal Action:**
- Soap weight + placement creates moment arm
- Frame tilts in direction of soap placement bias
- Tilt causes edge geometry to engage (90° edge creates bite)
- Frictional containment from minimal contact + gimbal tilt
- Frames swing within <45° limit, creating variable grip strength

**Why Dimensionality Matters:**
- Frame height, width, and pivot position determine swing characteristics
- Weight distribution (bottom vs. top) affects self-righting
- Soap placement relative to pivot point creates leverage
- Edge angle + tilt angle = gripping force magnitude

#### 5. Drainage System (NO HOLES BY DESIGN)

**How water is managed:**
- Residual water drips OFF elevated soap (gravity)
- Water falls to hull floor (intentional collection)
- Open top enables airflow circulation
- Airflow evaporates water from both soap AND hull floor
- NO drain holes needed - evaporation system

**Why this works for soap preservation:**
- Soap stays dry (minimal contact, elevated)
- Air circulation prevents moisture buildup
- Water doesn't sit against soap (elevated above floor)
- Soap lasts longer, doesn't deteriorate

**This is NOT a traditional soap dish. This is soap ELEVATION technology.**
**This is NOT a canoe. This is a SOAP PRESERVATION device that HAPPENS to look like a canoe.**

---

### Scale and Construction

- **Size:** ~150mm length (scaled for standard bar soap ~100mm × 50mm)
- **Form:** Miniature canoe/boat aesthetic
- **Assembly:** Two-piece (hull + removable gimbaled frame)
- **Concept Origin:** GCSC_v2.6.1 (seed specification)
- **Working Reference:** v5.3 Final Assembly (Inheritable_Dimensions/)

**See:** `Inbox/GCSC_v2.6.1.md` for original concept seed

---

#### 0.2 Fundamental Product Characteristics

**These define WHAT GCSC is at the conceptual level:**

**Form Identity:**
- **Canoe/boat aesthetic** - Pointed ends, curved sides, nautical character
- **Open-topped vessel** - No closed lid or sealed top surface
- **Hollow interior** - Contains cavity for soap accommodation
- **Two-piece design** - Separable hull and frame components

**Mechanical Identity:**
- **Stationary hull** - Base vessel, holds frame
- **Pivoting frame** - Movable component inside hull
- **Gimbal/pivot mechanism** - Frame swings/rotates to grip soap
- **Gravity interaction** - Self-righting or stabilizing behavior
- **Soap gripping action** - Frame members contact and hold soap bar

**Functional Identity:**
- **Soap accommodation** - Holds standard bar soap (~100mm × 50mm × 25mm)
- **Drainage capability** - Water does not pool (open design or deliberate drainage)
- **Stable base** - Rests securely on counter/surface
- **Accessible design** - Soap and frame can be inserted/removed from above

---

#### 0.3 Mandatory Functional Requirements

**These are NON-NEGOTIABLE across all phases and versions:**

**FR-0: Soap Elevation and Drainage-Free Design (THE CORNERSTONE)**

**This is the defining innovation. If this is violated, it is not GCSC.**

**Soap Elevation Requirements:**
- Soap MUST be elevated ABOVE hull floor (pedestalized on frame)
- Contact: Minimal line contact on frame top member edges (NOT surface contact)
- Frame top members MUST have geometry that creates gripping bite
- Soap MUST rest ACROSS two frame top members (spanning Y-axis)
- Soap position: ABOVE hull interior, NOT touching floor

**Frame Geometry Requirements:**
- Frame shape: Inverse trapezoid or similar (narrower bottom, wider top)
- Top member profile: Flat top transitioning to sharp/right-angle edge
- Top members span Y-axis (width of canoe)
- Frame pivot mechanism enables gimbal action for gripping

**NO DRAIN HOLES Principle:**
- Hull floor MUST NOT have drain holes (by design, not omission)
- Water drips from elevated soap to hull floor (intentional)
- Water evaporates via airflow from open top
- Soap stays DRY because it's elevated with minimal contact

**Why This Matters:**
- Traditional soap dishes = soap sits in water, needs drain holes
- GCSC innovation = soap elevated, water below, airflow dries both
- This is the CORE CONCEPT that differentiates GCSC from all other soap dishes

**Test:**
- Soap bar placed on assembled frame stays elevated above hull floor
- No drain holes visible in hull floor
- Frame top members have edge geometry (not flat surface)
- Water can collect at floor without contacting elevated soap

**Authority:** Creator's conceptual cornerstone - this IS the GCSC invention

**Authority:** Creator's 5-year brainchild - this IS the GCSC invention

**This is NOT replicating a canoe. This is a NEW INVENTION for soap preservation using gimbal mechanics and elevation.**

---

**FR-1: Open-Top Access (Enables Airflow)**
- Hull MUST be open at the top (no sealed surface)
- Open top enables airflow circulation for evaporation
- Interior cavity MUST be accessible from above
- Frame MUST be installable/removable from top opening
- **Why Open Top:** Not just aesthetics - airflow is functional requirement for drainage-free design
- **Test:** Can see into hull from top view; air circulates freely
- **Authority:** Open top enables the evaporation system (part of FR-0 innovation)

**FR-2: Frame Gimbal Mechanism**
- Frame MUST pivot/rotate relative to hull (gimbal action)
- Pivot creates gripping bite when soap placement tilts frame
- Mechanism: pins, balls, hinges, or research-backed pivot geometry
- Gimbal effect + minimal contact edges = frictional soap containment
- **Test:** Frame demonstrably moves/tilts relative to stationary hull
- **Authority:** Gimbal action is how the gripping bite works (FR-0 mechanism)

**FR-3: Soap Bar Accommodation**
- Interior volume MUST accommodate standard soap bar (~100mm × 50mm × 25mm)
- Soap MUST rest ON frame top member edges (not in hull)
- Frame separation and geometry MUST support soap elevation
- Soap MUST be insertable/removable through top access
- **Test:** Standard soap bar rests across frame top members, stays elevated
- **Authority:** Primary functional purpose (FR-0 implementation)

**FR-4: Canoe Aesthetic Form**
- Overall shape MUST read as "boat" or "canoe" when viewed
- Pointed ends or directional form required (bow/stern character)
- Hull form must be vessel-like (not box, not cylinder)
- **Test:** Recognizable as miniature canoe by visual inspection
- **Authority:** Product name and market identity

**FR-5: Structural Stability**
- Assembled product MUST sit stable on flat surface
- Hull MUST not tip during normal use
- Frame MUST not fall out or disengage unintentionally
- **Test:** Rests securely; frame stays in place when lifted
- **Authority:** Basic usability requirement

---

#### 0.4 What GCSC Is NOT

**Forbidden design characteristics that violate core concept:**

❌ **NOT a traditional soap dish** - Soap does NOT sit in the hull touching the floor
❌ **NOT drain-hole based** - NO drain holes in hull (water evaporates via airflow, not drains)
❌ **NOT surface-contact design** - Soap contact must be minimal EDGES, not flat surfaces
❌ **NOT a closed vessel** - Sealed top prevents airflow (violates drainage-free system)
❌ **NOT purely decorative** - Must functionally elevate and dry soap
❌ **NOT a fixed single piece** - Hull and frame must be separable
❌ **NOT a simple box** - Must have boat/vessel aesthetic character
❌ **NOT a static design** - Frame must gimbal/pivot (creates gripping bite)
❌ **NOT inaccessible** - Interior must be reachable from top

**CRITICAL VIOLATIONS (immediate rejection):**
- Adding drain holes to hull floor
- Soap resting on hull floor (not elevated)
- Flat-surface soap contact (not edge contact)
- Sealed top (prevents airflow)
- No frame gimbal action

**If any forbidden characteristic appears, the design violates Article 0.**

**Common LLM Mistakes to AVOID:**
- "Let's add drain holes" ← NO! Violates FR-0 cornerstone
- "Soap sits in the dish" ← NO! Soap is ELEVATED on frame
- "Flat top rails for comfort" ← NO! Edges create bite (FR-0)
- Assuming traditional soap dish drainage patterns

#### 0.5 Reference Standards

**Canonical Working Example: v5.3 Final Assembly**

Location: `Inheritable_Dimensions/Final_Assembly/`

**Why v5.3 is the reference:**
- Proven functionality (7/7 compatibility checks)
- Physical user testing validated
- Production-ready STL files exist
- Shows concept successfully implemented

**What to reference from v5.3:**
- ✅ Visual form (what it looks like)
- ✅ Functional proof (that it works)
- ✅ Scale and proportions (soap dish size)
- ✅ Open-top geometry (visible interior)
- ✅ Frame pivot mechanism (balls in slots)

**What NOT to copy from v5.3:**
- ❌ Implementation approach (GCSC2 uses research-backed methods)
- ❌ Specific code structure (v5.x was monolithic, GCSC2 is modular)
- ❌ Parameter names (GCSC2 uses semantic naming)
- ❌ Geometric algorithms (GCSC2 researches best approaches)

**Conceptual Seed: GCSC_v2.6.1**

Location: `Inbox/GCSC_v2.6.1.md`

**Why v2.6.1 is referenced:**
- Original vision document
- Establishes core concept (canoe + gimbal + soap gripping)
- Defines functional intent

**What to extract from v2.6.1:**
- ✅ Core concept (what it is)
- ✅ Functional purpose (why it exists)
- ✅ Mechanical principle (frame pivots to grip)

**What NOT to use from v2.6.1:**
- ❌ Specific implementation (problematic design approach)
- ❌ Geometric methodology (black-boxed, bug-prone)
- ❌ Design language that didn't work
- ❌ Any implementation details

---

#### 0.6 Visual Reference Requirements

**Required Reference Images** (to be created in `docs/reference_images/`):

**From v5.3 Final Assembly:**
1. **`v5.3_overview.jpg`** - Complete assembled canoe (shows overall form)
2. **`v5.3_top_view.jpg`** - Looking down into open hull (shows accessible interior)
3. **`v5.3_frame_detail.jpg`** - Frame component showing pivot mechanism
4. **`v5.3_with_soap.jpg`** - Functional use case (soap bar in place)
5. **`v5.3_pivot_action.jpg`** - Frame tilted/pivoted (shows mechanical action)

**Purpose of references:**
- LLMs have no persistent visual memory
- Each conversation starts without knowledge of "what GCSC looks like"
- References establish canonical appearance
- Prevents conceptual drift (closed vessels, non-canoe forms)

**Reference Usage:**
- Show to LLM at start of design work
- Compare renders against references during validation
- Use as "this is what we're making" proof

---

#### 0.7 Validation Priority and Enforcement

**CRITICAL: Product identity validation BEFORE technical validation**

**Validation Sequence (MANDATORY):**

```
GATE 0: PRODUCT IDENTITY (Article 0 - THIS GATE)
├─ Visual: Is it open-topped? (FR-1)
├─ Visual: Does it look like a canoe? (FR-4)
├─ Mechanical: Does frame pivot? (FR-2)
├─ Functional: Can it hold soap? (FR-3)
├─ Stable: Does it sit flat? (FR-5)
└─ FAIL ANY = REJECT IMMEDIATELY

GATE 1-5: TECHNICAL VALIDATION (Article IV)
├─ Parameter sanity
├─ Build validation
├─ Manifold check
├─ Dimensional accuracy
└─ Only execute if GATE 0 PASSED
```

**Rationale:**
- Technically perfect closed vessel = 100% failure
- Slightly imperfect open canoe = refinable success
- Product identity cannot be "fixed later"

---

#### 0.8 Phase-Specific Application

**Phase 1: Minimalist Prototyping**

Article 0 requirements apply with these interpretations:

**Minimalism applies to:**
- Code complexity (simple, readable implementations)
- Parameter count (essential dimensions only)
- Build time (quick iteration cycles)
- Aesthetic details (fair curves deferred to Phase 2)

**Minimalism does NOT apply to:**
- Functional requirements (FR-1 through FR-5 are MANDATORY)
- Product identity (must look like canoe, must be open-topped)
- Core mechanism (frame must pivot, even if simplified)

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:**
- All FR-1 through FR-5 satisfied
- Design validated through physical test print
- Proves concept works with minimal implementation

**Phase 2: Production Quality**

All Article 0 requirements remain, with enhancements:

**Phase 2 additions:**
- Improved aesthetics (fair curves, smooth surfaces, refined form)
- Enhanced mechanism (optimized pivot geometry, better tolerances)
- Production features (decorations, branding, aesthetic refinement)
- Research-backed implementation (BOSL2, advanced geometry)

**Phase 2 preserves:**
- Same core concept (FR-1 through FR-5)
- Same visual identity (canoe form)
- Same functional purpose (soap holding with pivot mechanism)

**Constitutional Principle:**

> *"Phases differ in implementation quality and aesthetic refinement, but NEVER in fundamental product identity."*

---

#### 0.9 Design Freedom Within Constraints

**Article 0 establishes boundaries, not prescriptions:**

**What Article 0 REQUIRES:**
- Open-topped form (FR-1)
- Canoe aesthetic (FR-4)
- Pivoting frame (FR-2)
- Soap accommodation (FR-3)
- Stable base (FR-5)

**What Article 0 PERMITS (research-driven decisions):**
- Pivot mechanism type (balls/slots, hinges, pins, innovative)
- Hull geometry approach (lofting, CSG, BOSL2 skinning)
- Frame structure design (trapezoidal, rectangular, organic)
- Parameter taxonomy (as long as semantic and researched)
- Wall thickness, clearances, tolerances (as long as functional)
- Aesthetic details (sheer curves, tumblehome, decorations)

**Design Principle:**
Article 0 says "you must end up with an open-topped canoe soap dish with pivoting frame." HOW you achieve that is determined by research (Article III.1) and phase requirements (Article III.3).

---

#### 0.10 Amendment to Existing Articles

**Article I.1 Project Identity - MODIFY:**

Current text:
> **GCSC2** is the OpenSCAD-based redesign of the Great Canadian Soap Canoe, developed under the **Universal Governor v1.1.0** framework...

Add after existing text:
> **Product Concept:** See Article 0 for complete product identity, core concept, and mandatory functional requirements.

**Article III.3 Phase Governance - ADD CLAUSE:**

Add to Phase 1 section:
> **Functional Requirements:** Article 0 (FR-1 through FR-5) are MANDATORY in Phase 1. Minimalism applies to code and parameters, NOT to product concept or core functionality.

Add to Phase 2 section:
> **Functional Requirements:** All Article 0 requirements from Phase 1 remain mandatory. Phase 2 adds aesthetic refinement and enhanced implementation, but does not alter core product concept.

**Article IV Quality Standards - ADD GATE 0:**

Add before existing 4.1:

> ### 4.0 Product Identity Validation (Gate 0)
>
> **MANDATORY FIRST GATE - Execute before all other validation**
>
> **Validation Questions:**
> 1. Is the hull open at the top? (FR-1)
> 2. Does it look like a canoe/boat? (FR-4)
> 3. Does the frame pivot/move? (FR-2)
> 4. Can it hold a soap bar? (FR-3)
> 5. Does it sit stable on a surface? (FR-5)
>
> **Enforcement:**
> - ANY "no" answer = IMMEDIATE FAILURE
> - Do not proceed to Gates 1-5 if Gate 0 fails
> - Error message: "Article 0 violation: [specific FR]"
> - Compare visual renders to v5.3 reference images
>
> **Authority:** Article 0 (Product Identity) supersedes technical validation

---

## Rationale for Amendment

**Why Article 0 is Critical:**

1. **Establishes Shared Context:** LLMs need explicit definition of product concept
2. **Prevents Fundamental Failures:** Catches "closed vessel" mistake immediately
3. **Prioritizes Correctly:** Concept validation before implementation validation
4. **Enables Design Freedom:** Defines WHAT without constraining HOW
5. **Preserves Vision:** Original concept (v2.6.1) anchors all development

**Why Article 0, not Article IX:**

- Product identity is foundational - prerequisite to governance laws
- Must be understood BEFORE reading operational articles
- Article 0 signals "prerequisite context"
- Mirrors constitutional structure (identity before process)

**Why Two References (v2.6.1 + v5.3):**

- **v2.6.1:** Original vision - WHAT we're trying to make
- **v5.3:** Working proof - Shows concept is achievable
- Neither dictates HOW GCSC2 implements it
- Both inform Article 0 conceptual boundaries
