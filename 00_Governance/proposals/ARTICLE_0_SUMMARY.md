# Article 0 Amendment - Quick Summary

**Created:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Proposal ready for user approval
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Fixes fundamental governance gap

---

## What Was Done

Created Article 0 (Product Identity) to fix the governance failure where LLMs generated closed submarines instead of open canoes.

---

## The Core Innovation (FR-0 - THE CORNERSTONE)

### GCSC Revolutionary Design

**Traditional soap dish:**
- Soap sits IN dish (on bottom)
- Needs drain holes
- Soap stays wet

**GCSC Innovation:**
- **Soap ELEVATED** on frame top member edges
- **NO drain holes** - water drips below, evaporates via airflow
- **Minimal contact** - two thin edge lines, not surface
- **Gimbal gripping** - frame tilt creates frictional bite
- Soap stays DRY

### Why This Matters

**This is NOT a soap dish with drain holes. This is soap ELEVATION technology.**

- Water collects at hull floor (by design)
- Open top enables airflow
- Evaporation dries both soap and hull
- No drain holes needed

---

## Key Requirements Added

**FR-0: Soap Elevation (THE CORNERSTONE - MOST IMPORTANT)**
- Soap elevated ABOVE hull floor
- Frame top members have edge geometry (flat→90° transition)
- NO drain holes in hull floor
- Water evaporates via airflow from open top

**FR-1: Open Top (Enables Airflow)**
- Open top is FUNCTIONAL (not just aesthetic)
- Airflow enables evaporation system

**FR-2: Frame Gimbal**
- Pivot creates gripping bite
- Inverse trapezoid shape (narrower bottom, wider top)

**FR-3: Soap Accommodation**
- Soap rests ACROSS two frame top members
- Elevated above hull interior

**FR-4: Canoe Aesthetic**
- Boat-like form

**FR-5: Structural Stability**
- Stable base

---

## Critical Prohibitions

**FORBIDDEN (immediate rejection):**
- ❌ Adding drain holes to hull
- ❌ Soap resting on hull floor
- ❌ Flat-surface soap contact (must be edge contact)
- ❌ Sealed/closed top
- ❌ No frame pivot mechanism

**Common LLM mistakes to prevent:**
- "Let's add drain holes" ← NO!
- "Soap sits in the dish" ← NO! Elevated on frame
- "Flat rails for comfort" ← NO! Edges create bite

---

## What Changed

### 1. Article 0 Added to Constitution (NEW)

Location: `00_Governance/proposals/2026-02-02-article-0-product-identity.md`

- Defines GCSC product concept
- Establishes FR-0 through FR-5 requirements
- References v2.6.1 (concept seed) and v5.3 (working proof)
- Does NOT prescribe HOW to implement

### 2. Validation Script Updated

File: `01_Prototype_Simple/validation_with_gemini.sh`

**Gate 0 added BEFORE technical validation:**
- FR-1: Is hull open-topped?
- FR-4: Does it look like a canoe?
- FR-2: Does frame pivot?
- FR-3: Can it hold soap?
- FR-5: Is it stable?

**If ANY fail → IMMEDIATE REJECTION, do not proceed**

### 3. Constitutional Amendments

**Article I.1:** Reference Article 0 for product identity
**Article III.3:** FR-0 through FR-5 mandatory in Phase 1
**Article IV.0:** Gate 0 (Product Identity) added before existing gates

---

## Why This Was Critical

**Problem:** LLMs don't know what GCSC is
- Generated closed vessels (submarines)
- Would add drain holes (violates innovation)
- Didn't understand soap elevation concept

**Solution:** Article 0 establishes product identity
- WHAT we're building (elevated soap, drainage-free)
- WHY it's different (airflow evaporation, not drain holes)
- Validates concept BEFORE technical details

---

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `00_Governance/proposals/2026-02-02-article-0-product-identity.md` (full proposal)
- `00_Governance/proposals/ARTICLE_0_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

**Modified:**
- `01_Prototype_Simple/validation_with_gemini.sh` (added Gate 0 checks)

**Pending:**
- Constitution update (after user approval)
- Quick_Reference.md update
- CHANGELOG.md entry

---

## Next Steps

1. **User reviews Article 0 proposal**
2. **User approves or requests changes**
3. **Insert Article 0 into Constitution** (before Article I)
4. **Update version to v2.1.0**
5. **Update Quick_Reference.md**
6. **Create reference images from v5.3**
7. **Test Gate 0 validation**
8. **Git commit amendment**

---

## Success Criteria

**Amendment succeeds when:**
- LLMs can explain "GCSC elevates soap, no drain holes"
- Gate 0 catches closed vessels immediately
- No LLM suggests adding drain holes
- Product concept stable across phases
- v5.3 demonstrates achievability without constraining GCSC2

---

## The Critical Point

**FR-0 is the cornerstone. If violated, it's not GCSC.**

The soap elevation and drainage-free system is the INNOVATION that makes GCSC unique. This must be preserved above all else.

**Traditional soap dish thinking = WRONG for GCSC**
**GCSC thinking = Soap pedestalization + airflow evaporation**
