# GCSC2 Governance Framework

**Version:** 2.0.0
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Project:** Great Canadian Soap Canoe v2 (GCSC2)
**Governance Model:** Universal Governor v1.1.0 Integration

---

## Purpose

This directory contains governance documentation **specific to GCSC2**, the OpenSCAD-based redesign of the Great Canadian Soap Canoe. This governance framework replaces the legacy GCSC v1-v5 governance found in `00_Governance_v1-v5_DEPRECATED_REFERENCE/`.

## Key Differences from Legacy Governance

**GCSC v1-v5 Governance** (deprecated):
- Python-based programmatic plate generation
- Antigravity AI tool integration
- Gemini-specific workflows
- Non-OpenSCAD canonical truth stack

**GCSC2 Governance** (current):
- OpenSCAD-based parametric design
- Universal Governor skill integration
- Claude Code development environment
- Research-driven design philosophy
- Git-native version control

## Governance Documents

### Core Constitution
- **[GCSC2_Constitution.md](GCSC2_Constitution.md)** - Supreme governance document defining principles, canonical truth stack, and development protocols

### Universal Governor Integration
- **[Universal_Governor_Integration.md](Universal_Governor_Integration.md)** - How Universal Governor skill operates within GCSC2 project context

### Operational Annexes
- **[Research_Driven_Design_Philosophy.md](Research_Driven_Design_Philosophy.md)** - Governance of research → design → implementation workflow
- **[Parameter_Taxonomy_Governance.md](Parameter_Taxonomy_Governance.md)** - Rules for parameter design and evolution
- **[Quality_Standards.md](Quality_Standards.md)** - Quality gates and validation requirements

## Quick Reference

**When to consult governance:**
- Before modifying canonical parameters (dimensions.scad)
- Before changing directory structure
- Before creating new development phases
- When research findings contradict current design
- When proposing architectural changes

**Decision Authority:**
1. Constitution (highest authority)
2. Research findings (documented in docs/)
3. Universal Governor skill (operational guidance)
4. Human-in-the-loop (final approval)

## Legacy Governance

Previous governance documents (GCSC v1-v5) are preserved in:
```
00_Governance_v1-v5_DEPRECATED_REFERENCE/
```

These documents remain for historical reference but **DO NOT apply to GCSC2 development**. Consult them only for understanding legacy design decisions.
