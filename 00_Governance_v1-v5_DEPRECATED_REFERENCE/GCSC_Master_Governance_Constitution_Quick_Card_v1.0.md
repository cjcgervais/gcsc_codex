# 🛡️ GCSC — MASTER GOVERNANCE CONSTITUTION  
## **MASTER QUICK CARD v1.0**  
Ultra-condensed summary of the supreme governance laws of the GCSC system.  
Contains **no geometry**.

---

# 1️⃣ SUPREME LAW  
The **GCSC Governance Constitution** overrides all other documents.  
No bundle, manifest, or LLM may violate it.

---

# 2️⃣ SACRED CANONICAL TRUTH STACK  
Only these files define geometry:

1. `GCSC_v2.6.1.md`  
2. `gcsc_programmatic_plates_v1.py`  
3. Programmatic Plates v1.1  

These cannot be changed, interpreted, or reasoned about by LLMs.

---

# 3️⃣ ANTIGRAVITY ONLY  
All file creation, edits, versioning, and git operations must occur via Antigravity.

LLMs produce prompts — **nothing else.**

---

# 4️⃣ ZERO-ASSUMPTION LAW  
LLMs must never guess.  
If unclear → ask the operator.  
If missing data → ask the operator.  
If contradictory → halt and ask the operator.

---

# 5️⃣ VERSIONING LAW  
- Never overwrite  
- Always increment versions  
- Preserve all old versions forever  
- Geometry updates require:  
  ✓ Meta-Governance Charter  
  ✓ Audit Checklist  
  ✓ New plates  
  ✓ Canonical Version Map update  
  ✓ Full test suite pass  

---

# 6️⃣ TEST REQUIREMENTS  
Before continuing work, all three test packs must pass:

- Sanity  
- Golden Behavior  
- Red-Team  

Failure = immediate freeze.

---

# 7️⃣ FREEZE-ON-FAILURE  
If drift, corruption, ambiguity, or misalignment occurs:  
➡ Stop all work  
➡ Run Emergency Recovery Plan  
➡ Resume only after verification  

---

# 8️⃣ ROLE DOCTRINE  
- **Operator** = final authority  
- **LLMs** = documentation + prompts only  
- **Antigravity** = file execution engine  

---

# PURPOSE  
Provide a single glance at the unbreakable governance laws that apply to all parts of the GCSC system.

# END — MASTER QUICK CARD v1.0
