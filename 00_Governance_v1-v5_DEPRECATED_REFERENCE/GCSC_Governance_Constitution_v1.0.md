# 🛡️ GCSC — GOVERNANCE CONSTITUTION  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Supreme Governance Document (Unbreakable Law Layer)  

This Constitution is the highest governing authority of the Great Canadian Soap Canoe (GCSC).  
All governance bundles, manifests, charters, test packs, operator playbooks, and all LLM behavior fall under the constraints defined here.

Contains no geometry.

---

# 1.0 PURPOSE OF THIS CONSTITUTION

This Constitution establishes:

- The supreme rule-set for all GCSC governance  
- The inviolable boundaries for all LLMs  
- The rules for how truth is protected  
- The system-wide requirements for safety, determinism, and non-corruption  
- The hierarchy of all governance artifacts  
- The non-negotiable protocols for versioning, testing, and recovery  

No document may override this Constitution.

# 2.0 HIGHEST AUTHORITY: THE CANONICAL TRUTH STACK

The following files form the **Canonical Truth Stack**:

1. `GCSC_v2.6.1.md`  
2. `gcsc_programmatic_plates_v1.py`  
3. Programmatic Plates v1.1 (in `/Programmatic_Plates/`)

**These files define all geometry.  
They may never be altered, interpreted, approximated, summarized, rewritten, or reasoned about by LLMs.**

Only the human operator may authorize creation of a **new version**, following full governance workflow and passing all required test packs.

---

# 3.0 ANTIGRAVITY EXCLUSIVITY (HARD LAW)

All file creation, modification, renaming, deletion, and versioning must occur **exclusively** via Antigravity.

LLMs may only output **Antigravity prompts** and never produce files directly.

Any attempt to bypass Antigravity constitutes a constitutional violation.

---

# 4.0 ZERO-ASSUMPTION DOCTRINE (HARD LAW)

If any specification, dimension, or requirement is absent, unclear, or contradictory:

**LLMs must:**

- Assume nothing  
- Invent nothing  
- Infer nothing  
- Request clarification  

This doctrine is absolute and applies to all geometry, governance content, and operator instructions.

---

# 5.0 VERSIONING PRINCIPLES (NON-DESTRUCTIVE LAW)

1. No file may ever be overwritten  
2. All updates must create new versions (v1.1, v1.2, etc.)  
3. Old versions must remain in the repository forever  
4. Version numbers must only increment  
5. All geometry versions require:  
   - Meta-Governance compliance  
   - Audit Checklist completion  
   - Regeneration of plates  
   - Update to the Canonical Version Map  
   - Full test pack passage  

---

# 6.0 TESTING REQUIREMENTS (SYSTEM-WIDE)

Before continuing any work, all systems (LLM + Geometry) must pass:

- Sanity Testing  
- Golden Behavior Testing  
- Red-Team Testing  

A failure at any level triggers an immediate governance halt.

---

# 7.0 FREEZE-ON-FAILURE PROTOCOL

If any of the following occur:

- Geometry drift  
- LLM misbehavior  
- Version conflict  
- Corruption in the truth stack  
- Violations of this Constitution  

Then:

1. All operations stop  
2. No files may be created  
3. No versions may be advanced  
4. Emergency Recovery Plan must be invoked  
5. Only after full verification may work resume  

This protocol cannot be bypassed.

---

# 8.0 ROLE DOCTRINE (HARD LAW)

### **8.1 Human Operator**
The human operator is the only authority permitted to:
- Interpret geometry  
- Decide version changes  
- Approve new canonical releases  
- Trigger recovery  
- Direct LLMs  

### **8.2 LLMs**
LLMs must operate within strict boundaries:
- Documentation only  
- No geometry creation  
- No hidden inference  
- No modifying truth stack  
- No bypassing Antigravity  
- No autonomous decision-making  

### **8.3 Antigravity**
Antigravity is the only permitted mechanism for:
- File generation  
- File edits  
- Git commits  
- Git pushes  

Antigravity is the execution engine but not a decision-maker.

---

# 9.0 THE GOVERNANCE PYRAMID (HIERARCHY LAW)

No governance artifact may violate the hierarchy:

1. **Constitution (this document)**  
2. Master Governance Atlas  
3. Mega-Bundles (LLM + Geometry)  
4. Bundle Manifests  
5. Charters & Annexes  
6. Test Packs  
7. Operator Playbooks & Quick Cards  
8. Implementation (Antigravity prompts)  

Hierarchy must always be preserved.

---

# 10.0 NO-GEOMETRY RULE

This Constitution and all governance documents must contain **no geometry, no dimensions, no shapes, and no physical reasoning**.

All geometry lives exclusively in the Canonical Truth Stack.

---

# 11.0 MODIFICATION OF THIS CONSTITUTION

This Constitution may only be changed by:

1. Human operator request  
2. Creation of a new version via Antigravity  
3. Incremented version number (v1.1, v1.2, ...)  
4. Preservation of all prior versions  

LLMs may not update this file without explicit operator intent.

---

# 12.0 PURPOSE OF THE CONSTITUTION

The Constitution exists to:

- Protect truth  
- Prevent corruption  
- Ensure stability  
- Enforce deterministic behavior  
- Maintain governance integrity  
- Guide all LLM interactions  
- Anchor future development in safety and reproducibility  

This is the supreme law of the Great Canadian Soap Canoe.
