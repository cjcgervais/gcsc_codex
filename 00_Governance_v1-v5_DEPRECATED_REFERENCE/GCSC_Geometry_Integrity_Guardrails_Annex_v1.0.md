# 🛡️ GCSC — GEOMETRY INTEGRITY GUARDRAILS ANNEX  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Geometry Governance Safety Layer  
Contains **no geometry.**

This annex establishes the **mandatory guardrails** that protect the geometry pipeline (Spec → Kernel → Plates) from corruption, drift, misalignment, or unauthorized changes.  

These guardrails ensure the geometry pillar remains deterministic, stable, and fully synchronized with governance requirements.

---

# 1.0 PURPOSE OF THIS ANNEX

The Geometry Integrity Guardrails exist to:

- Protect the Canonical Spec from unauthorized influence  
- Preserve deterministic relationships between Spec, Kernel, and Plates  
- Prevent drift caused by LLM behavior  
- Enforce strict separation between Governance Pillar and Geometry Pillar  
- Ensure all geometry generation aligns with the Constitution and Atlas  
- Maintain a clean “Truth Stack” without cross-contamination  
- Guarantee repeatability across future versions  

This annex is binding for both humans and LLMs.

---

# 2.0 POSITION IN THE HIERARCHY

This annex is subordinate to:

1. Governance Constitution  
2. Master Governance Atlas  
3. Consolidated Ultra-Bundle Manifest  
4. Meta-Bundle Manifest  
5. Geometry Governance Bundle Manifest v2.0  

It governs what geometry *may* and *may not* do — without containing geometry.

---

# 3.0 THE TRUTH STACK (GEOMETRY PILLAR)

The geometry pillar consists of exactly three layers:

1. **Canonical Spec**  
   - Numeric values  
   - Loft rules  
   - Z-stack  
   - Dimensions and hard constraints  

2. **Geometry Kernel**  
   - Programmatic script implementing the Spec  
   - Deterministic  
   - No assumptions or approximations beyond explicitly defined math  

3. **Programmatic Plates**  
   - Output of the Kernel  
   - Canonical diagrams in SVG/PNG  
   - Authoritative for all artistic or illustrative visuals  

**Guardrail Rule:**  
No other document may define geometry.

---

# 4.0 CORE INTEGRITY GUARDRAILS

Each guardrail is mandatory and non-negotiable.

---

## **G1 — No Geometry in Governance**
Governance documents may not:
- Define numeric values  
- Suggest dimensions  
- Re-express geometry in text  
- Modify or restate parameters  

All geometry exists only in the Spec, Kernel, and Plates.

---

## **G2 — Programmatic Plates Are Canonical**
Artistic drawings, AI images, or sketches:
- May illustrate  
- May clarify  
- May not override or imply geometry  

Only programmatic plates define the canonical shape.

---

## **G3 — The Kernel Must Match the Spec 1:1**
The kernel:
- Must use Spec constants directly  
- Must not infer missing values  
- Must not “smooth,” “adjust,” or “interpret” geometry  
- Must not use LLM-generated numbers  

Only deterministic math derived from the Spec is allowed.

---

## **G4 — The Spec May Only Be Updated Through Governance**
Spec updates require:
- A governance discussion  
- New Spec version  
- Corresponding Kernel version bump  
- Regeneration of plates  

No direct edits.  
No assumptions.  
No LLM-generated “fixes.”

---

## **G5 — No Hidden Geometry Logic**
The kernel must not contain:
- Hidden offsets  
- Implicit constants  
- Non-linear adjustments unless defined in Spec  
- Developer-created “corrections”  

All math must map transparently to the Spec.

---

## **G6 — Geometry Stability Over Time**
For a given Spec version:
- Output must be identical  
- Kernel must be deterministic  
- Plates must match bit-for-bit (aside from export metadata)  

If plates change unexpectedly → Freeze-on-Failure.

---

## **G7 — No Cross-Pillar Drift**
Governance may not:
- Describe geometry  
- Re-express geometry logic  
- Propose geometry values  

Geometry may not:
- Reference governance rules in code  
- Implicitly modify governance behavior  

Dual-Pillar separation is absolute.

---

## **G8 — Strict Version Synchronization**
Valid geometry state requires all three aligned versions:

- Spec version  
- Kernel version  
- Plate version  

If any mismatch → Geometry Freeze is required.

---

## **G9 — Recovery Requires the Full Recovery System**
If geometry corruption is suspected:
- Invoke Freeze-on-Failure  
- Engage Recovery Bundle Manifest  
- Use Recovery Script  
- Validate Canonical Version Map  

Geometry generation may not resume until fully restored.

---

## **G10 — Human Operator Supremacy**
In all geometry questions:
- Human operator approves  
- Human operator confirms  
- LLM must not propose geometry  
- LLM must request clarification for any missing dimension  

No assumptions permitted.

---

# 5.0 OPERATIONAL RULES FOR GEOMETRY GENERATION

These rules govern how geometry is safely regenerated.

---

### **O1 — All geometry generation must reference one Spec version only.**  
No multi-spec blending.

### **O2 — Kernel must be updated only after Spec updates.**  
Never the reverse.

### **O3 — Programmatic plates must always be regenerated after kernel changes.**  

### **O4 — Antigravity performs all file creation and updates, never the LLM.**  

### **O5 — LLM must request missing dimensions instead of inferring.**  

### **O6 — Geometry may never be described in words by governance files.**  

### **O7 — All geometry outputs must be stored in the canonical directory.**  

---

# 6.0 UPDATE RULES

This annex must be updated when:

- New geometry rules are added  
- Kernel changes materially affect pipeline governance  
- Recovery/Failure systems evolve  
- Ultra-Bundle structures change  
- Cross-pillar boundaries tighten  

Rules:

- Never overwrite  
- Always increment version  
- Antigravity only  
- No geometry added  

---

# 7.0 ROLE OF THIS ANNEX

This annex is the **safety harness** of the Geometry Pillar.

It provides:

- Drift prevention  
- Failure prevention  
- Pipeline integrity  
- Protection of the canonical truth  
- Behavioral safety for LLM + operator  
- Long-term deterministic reproducibility  

It ensures that geometry remains **exact**, **stable**, and **untouched by drift**.
